### Hello, I'm Harshil Padsala, 
I am a Flutter developer, and currently in search for an internship, to sharpen and polish my programming skills, and also to astound my seniors by working very hard, and scratching my head, until I have found a solution for the problem. <br>
Well, below are some of the projects that I did while I was in my quest to understand, Flutter's Architecure, its various state management, and how to handle REST. 

# 1) Recipe Finder App:
- An app for users to make queries for Recipes, therequests facilitated by <b><i>Edamam Recipe API</b></i>.
- Bookmarking and a check-list for requisite groceries implemented and handled with <b><i>Provider StateManagement</b></i> and <b><i>Streams</b></i>.
- Used <b><i>Chopper<b><i> and <b><i>JSON Serializable</b></i> for concrete,handling of HTTP requests and JSON data.
